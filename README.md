## 📚 Overview

EnhancedPets is a powerful and feature-rich plugin designed to make Minecraft petting smoother. Whether you're running a Survival, Factions, or any other type of server, EnhancedPets provides everything you need to make pets more fun and useful than vanilla.

Our goal is to provide a solution that is both **easy to use** for players and **highly configurable** for server administrators. EnhancedPets is a new plugin idea, not copied from others.
